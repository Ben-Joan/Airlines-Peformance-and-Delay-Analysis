# Airlines-Peformance-and-Delay-Analysis

Air travel is an essential component of global mobility, connecting people, businesses, and economies. However, flight delays remain a persistent challenge in the aviation industry, affecting millions of passengers each year and causing substantial financial and operational setbacks for airlines. Delays not only inconvenience travelers but also ripple across airline schedules, airport operations, and supply chains, highlighting the need for a data-driven understanding of their causes and patterns.

Analyzing flight data provides critical insights into operational inefficiencies, and external factors that affects/cause flight delay. This project leverages real-world flight data to explore delay patterns, offering actionable insights that can help airlines optimize schedules, enhance customer experience, and improve overall on-time performance.
