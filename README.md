# Airlines-Peformance-and-Delay-Analysis

Air travel is an essential component of global mobility, connecting people, businesses, and economies. However, flight delays remain a persistent challenge in the aviation industry, affecting millions of passengers each year and causing substantial financial and operational setbacks for airlines. Delays not only inconvenience travelers but also ripple across airline schedules, airport operations, and supply chains, highlighting the need for a data-driven understanding of their causes and patterns.

Analyzing flight data provides critical insights into operational inefficiencies, and external factors that affects/cause flight delay. This project leverages real-world flight data to explore delay patterns, offering actionable insights that can help airlines optimize schedules, enhance customer experience, and improve overall on-time performance.

## Project Objective
The project aims to analyze airline performance and flight delays to identify trends, causes, and opportunities for improving punctuality and operational efficiency.

#### Some Key Questions to guide analysis include:
1. Which months and airports experience the highest flight traffic?  
2. During which periods are flight delays most frequent, and how do they vary across airlines?  
3. What are the primary reasons for flight delays (carrier, weather, late aircraft, etc.)?  
4. Which airports or regions are most affected by delays, particularly due to weather, and are there coastal vs. inland patterns?  
5. What percentage of flights experience delays over 15 minutes, and which airlines or airports have the best on-time performance?
